## About

Sr. Machine Learning Engineer at Boise Cascade. Manufacturing lifer turned data scientist turned cyber engineer. I started on the production floor and worked my way through every level of plant operations before pivoting to ML and security.

Now I build anomaly detection systems, deploy ML at the edge, and harden the systems that run it all. Equal parts data, DevOps, SecOps, and whatever else needs doing.

### Currently into

- Anomaly detection in temporal data
- Agentic AI systems
- Software defined radio (SDR)
- IoT and edge ML
- System hardening and network security

### Published work

- *Computers & Industrial Engineering* (peer-reviewed)
- *Stochastic Optimization for Veneer Dryer Control*
- *Scaling IoT ML for Predictive Maintenance*

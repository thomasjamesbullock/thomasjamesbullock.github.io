New site, new format.

I've migrated from the old portfolio template to a minimal terminal-style blog. The previous site served its purpose, but it was time for something that better reflects where I'm at — less template, more terminal.

Going forward, I plan to write about:

- **Machine learning in manufacturing** — anomaly detection, temporal networks, and the messy reality of deploying ML in industrial environments
- **Data engineering** — pipelines, process control, and making sense of sensor data at scale
- **Security** — hardening systems, network monitoring, and the overlap between manufacturing OT and IT security
- **Tools and workflow** — the Linux tools, automation patterns, and development practices that make the work possible

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around.
